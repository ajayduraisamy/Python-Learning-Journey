# CIFAR-10 CNN Notes (Day 6)

### New Concepts:

### 1. Batch Normalization
Stabilizes training and helps model converge faster.

### 2. Dropout
Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping neurons.

### 3. Data Augmentation
Artificially expands the dataset by transforming images.

### 4. Checkpoints
Automatically saves best model during training.

### 5. Deeper CNN
Multiple conv layers extract higher-level features.
