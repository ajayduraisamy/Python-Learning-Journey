# Day 122 – Mini Transformer Experiment

This day combines multiple Transformer concepts
into a minimal working experiment.

Included:
- Self-attention with scaling
- Causal masking
- Position-aware representations
- Autoregressive token processing

Goal is to understand data flow inside a Transformer,
not to build a production model.
