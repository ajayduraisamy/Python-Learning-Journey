# Day 125 – Context Window Behavior in LLMs

LLMs attend over a fixed-size context window.
As context grows, models exhibit recency bias
and may ignore early tokens.

Covered:
- Fixed context limits
- Recency vs position effects
- Truncation and information loss
- Engineering strategies to mitigate forgetting
