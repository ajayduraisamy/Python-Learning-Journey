# Day 117 – CNN Optimization Concepts

This day focuses on practical CNN design choices
that make deep convolutional networks trainable.

Covered:
- Effect of padding and stride on feature maps
- Why pooling reduces overfitting
- How spatial downsampling improves efficiency
- Design intuition behind modern CNN architectures

Focus is on understanding behavior, not framework APIs.
