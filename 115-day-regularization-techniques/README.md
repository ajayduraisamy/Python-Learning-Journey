# Day 115 – Regularization Techniques in Deep Learning

Regularization improves generalization by controlling
model complexity and training dynamics.

Covered:
- L2 regularization (weight decay)
- Dropout (stochastic regularization)
- Batch Normalization (training stabilization)

Each technique solves a different problem and should
be applied with intent, not blindly.
