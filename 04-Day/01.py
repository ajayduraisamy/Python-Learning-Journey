# LISTS (with explanation inside code)

# LIST BASICS
# A list is used to store multiple values in one variable.
# We use square brackets [] to create a list.

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print("Numbers list:", numbers)

names = ["Ajay", "Rahul", "Kumar"]
print("Names list:", names)

# Lists can store different types
mixed = [10, "Ajay", 5.5, True]
print("Mixed list:", mixed)


# Explanation (Simple):

# List = multiple values in one place

# Values separated by commas

# Can store text, numbers, boolean → anything
