# Day 113 – Weight Initialization in Deep Learning

Weight initialization plays a critical role in how fast
and how well a neural network trains.

This day covers:
- Problems with naive initialization
- Vanishing and exploding activations
- Xavier (Glorot) initialization
- He initialization for ReLU networks

Poor initialization can prevent learning completely.
