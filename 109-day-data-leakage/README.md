# Day 109 – Data Leakage in Machine Learning

Data leakage happens when information from outside the training
dataset is used to create the model, leading to unrealistically
high performance.

Types covered:
- Train-test leakage
- Target leakage
- Preprocessing leakage

This is a critical real-world ML engineering issue and a common
cause of model failure in production.
