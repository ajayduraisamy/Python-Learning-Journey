# Day 103 – Python Internals: Memory Model & Mutability

This day focuses on understanding how Python manages memory,
object identity, references, and mutability.

Topics covered:
- Object identity (`id`)
- Reference vs value
- Mutable vs immutable objects
- How Python handles variable assignment
- Common pitfalls in real-world code

This knowledge is critical for writing bug-free,
memory-efficient Python applications.
