# Day 128 – RAG vs Fine-Tuning

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning
solve different problems in LLM systems.

Covered:
- What fine-tuning actually changes
- What RAG actually adds
- Cost, latency, and maintenance trade-offs
- Decision framework: when to use which

Choosing the wrong approach leads to expensive failures.
