# Day 114 – Optimizers: SGD vs Momentum vs Adam

This day revisits optimizers from an engineering perspective.

Key focus:
- Why Adam converges faster
- Why SGD often generalizes better
- Role of momentum in stabilizing SGD
- Why many research papers switch from Adam to SGD

This is not about usage, but about optimizer behavior.
