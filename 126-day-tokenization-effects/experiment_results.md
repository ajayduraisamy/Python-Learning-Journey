## Tokenization Experiment

### Observations
- Hyphens, emails, URLs increase token count
- Long technical words split into subwords
- Small prompt edits can save many tokens

### Implications
- Context window fills faster than expected
- Cost increases non-linearly
- Token-aware prompt design is mandatory
