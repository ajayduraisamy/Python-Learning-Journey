# Day 130 – Retrieval Quality Evaluation in RAG

RAG systems fail silently when retrieval quality is poor.
Good generation cannot fix bad retrieval.

Covered:
- Why accuracy is not enough
- Recall@K and Precision@K intuition
- Ground-truth based evaluation
- Practical retrieval sanity checks

Evaluation must focus on retrieval before generation.
