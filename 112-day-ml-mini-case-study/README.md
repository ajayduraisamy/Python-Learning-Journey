# Day 112 – Mini Machine Learning Case Study

This day demonstrates a small end-to-end machine learning
case study with a proper engineering workflow.

Covered:
- Problem definition
- Dataset preparation
- Train-test split
- Model training
- Evaluation using correct metrics

Focus is on reasoning and correctness, not just accuracy.
