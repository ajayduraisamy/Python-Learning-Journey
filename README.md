**Author:** Ajay Duraisamy

**Duration:** 100+ Days of Continuous Learning & Building
**Tech Stack:** Python, ML, DL, Transformers, LLMs, TensorFlow, PyTorch

---

##  Overview

This repository is a **complete learning + building journey** from:

> **Python fundamentals → Machine Learning → Deep Learning → Transformers → GPT → RoPE → BPE → FlashAttention → LoRA Fine-Tuning**

Unlike tutorial-based repos, this project focuses on:

*  **Concept clarity**
*  **From-scratch implementations**
*  **Incremental daily commits**
*  **Real-world AI engineering practices**

This repo represents **real engineering growth**, not copied code.

##  Learning Roadmap (Day-wise Breakdown)

---

##  Phase 1: Python Fundamentals (Day 1 – Day 40)

**Core Python mastery with practical exercises**

Topics:

* Variables, data types, operators

* Exception handling
* OOP & magic methods
* Regex, JSON, datetime
* Multithreading & multiprocessing
* Async programming
* Testing with pytest
* Logging, packages, modules

 Examples:

```
01-day → 40-day
about_me.py
intro_program.py
threading/
multiprocessing/
pytest/
```

---

##  Phase 2: Python Projects & Utilities (Day 41 – Day 46)

**Small real-world utilities**
